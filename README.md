This repository accompanies “No increased brain age gap in persistent post-COVID-19 headache.” We trained a structural MRI brain-age model on a large, multi-dataset healthy sample and applied it to adults with persistent post-COVID headache (n=53) and matched controls (n=48), with follow-up in patients (n=30). Morphometric features were extracted via FastSurfer and harmonised across scanners with ComBat-GAM; statistical analyses adjusted for age, sex, eTIV, and Euler number. Results showed no cross-sectional elevation in brain-age gap and no systematic longitudinal change. As a robustness check, we replicated the analysis with the external deep-learning model Pyment, obtaining qualitatively similar null findings.
